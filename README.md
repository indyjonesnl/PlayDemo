# PlayDemo

This code is relevant for the following versions:

Play Framework: 2.5.0

This demo comes with default H2 database settings and Ebeans default "models.*" entity management.

You can use this example project with activator, sbt or for example IntelliJ.

When using activator:

    activator
    
    compile
    
    run

Or sbt:

    sbt
    
    compile
    
    run

Or JetBrain's awesome IntelliJ IDEA:

HOWEVER, keep in mind the Play Framework is still changing so much that almost all available documentation is already out of date tomorrow. The video also shows some programming styles that have already been deprecated.
